# Photohead mechanics

The purpose of this repository is to store all the required material needed for building the mechanical parts of the motorized pan & tilt head.

This includes (non exhaustive list):
 - CAD files (FreeCAD source files, STL files).
 - 2D / technical drawings.
 - List of hardware components (e.g.: motors, pulleys, 3D printed parts, etc...).
 - Assembly guide.

FreeCAD version used throughout this project is v0.21.2.

ðŸš§: **TODO**: Clearly indicate which parts are meants to be 3D-printed.
